# eCommerce
The eCommerce application is written in C# using the MVC(Models, Views, Controlers) structure. This application provides the functionality of an online video game store. This application could also work with many different types of products that fit the same criteria(Books, Movies, etc.). The eCommerce application is in the early stages of development and will later be updated and enhanced in many ways that will add to performance and production. We will also be keeping everyone interested updated with changes that will be occuring along the way.
